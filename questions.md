1. How to not bind operations to the wrong real resource? So in a way that blocks further operatrions from being bound?

2. What exactly does the paper refer to with ResourceUsed(step, type(x_i))? If we have one ADD scheduled and 2 ALUs, this does not mean that another ADD can be scheduled, as there might also be another operation already bound to the second ALUs
