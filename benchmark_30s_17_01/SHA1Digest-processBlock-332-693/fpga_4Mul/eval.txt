Printing BULB metrics for lBoundEstimator: ASAP, ALAPBound: lazyALAP
BULB tree contains 2 inspected nodes
0 tried intervals violated resource constraints and were not further inspected
Lower == Upper reached: true, 1 times
Best latency found: 21
Initial best latency: 21
81 out of 82 DFG nodes could be skipped to find best schedule
It took -1 milliseconds to converge
Scheduling took 39 milliseconds
